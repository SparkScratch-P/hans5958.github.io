			<p>Hello, I'm <strong>Hans5958</strong>. I'm a guy who has a passion in tech and computers in general.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>As your usual internet citizen, I surf the internet for mostly fun, but often I learn new things, and occasionally make things that people might find it usual, such as articles, videos, and even scripts and programs.</p>
			<p>I can call myself proficient in front-end stuff. That is with HTML5, JS, and CSS, but I will keep learning new stuff on the road. Currently, I'm learning how to do Python, and probably some deeper front-end stuff, and maybe, in the future, go into the world of Windows software development and back-end stuff.</p>
			<p>I don't have a certain large project that is in focus. I only do small projects here and there. But, hey, it's "honest work". If you ask about something that I can proud of, go check my <a href="https://mini.hans5958.me">Mini HTMLs</a>.</p>
			<p>Outside programming, I also like to write things about anything that I interest, from translation, collecting text, editing Wikipedia articles, or just writing normal articles. You can search through my repos for that, or go to <a href="https://hans5958.github.io/blog">my blog</a>.</p>
			<p>I also like to chat with my friends, try to be the best on my school, and having a great time with my family, if you ask.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>You may contact me through email or through <a href="https://hans5958.me/accounts">one of my social media accounts</a>.</p>
			<p>You want other stuff than tech? Go check out <a href="https://youtube.com/Hans5958">my YouTube channel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Hans5958">my Twitter account</a>, and <a href="https://hans5958.github.io/blog">my blog</a>. I also publish some random texts on <a href="https://gist.github.com/Hans5958">my Gists</a>.</p>		</div>
